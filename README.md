Welcome to the Pallet Town Pokemon lab software engineering division! We've been a little short handed ever since our intern, Ash, left to go become a Pokemon Master or some such nonsense. He was working on a project to allow trainers to plan out their ultimate team of Pokemon.

We'd like you to finish it up, and while you're in there fix any of his mistakes. If he's as good at training Pokemon as writing code... I feel sorry for that Pikachu. Anyways, here's some notes he had on the project that we found after he left:

TODO:
- Make the Pokemon search work
- Figure out why the Pokemon list doesn't load until I change generations
- The Pokemon types stopped working after I did some cleanup... can't imagine why (need to make sure the colors appear correctly too)
- Need to limit the team to 6 pokemon

Please make the tool the best you can, we're counting on you!
